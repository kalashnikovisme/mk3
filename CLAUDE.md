## Project: FightingAI Framework

Ruby framework for training AI agents to play fighting games through real emulators.

## Key Constraints

- Ruby is the primary language. Python may only appear behind ML adapter boundaries and never in the public API.
- Do not use gym-retro as the primary runtime.
- Core (`lib/fighting_ai/core/`) must have zero knowledge of any specific game, emulator, memory address, or Lua script.
- Emulator adapters (`lib/fighting_ai/emulator/`) must have zero knowledge of any specific game.
- Input devices (`lib/fighting_ai/input/`) must have zero knowledge of any specific game or emulator internals.
- Observation types (`lib/fighting_ai/observation/`) live outside Core and outside the emulator layer.
- Game adapters (`lib/fighting_ai/game/`) contain all game-specific knowledge.
- Agents (`lib/fighting_ai/agent/`) operate only on `Core::Observation` and `Core::Action`.

## Architecture Layers

```
Core → Input Device → Emulator Adapter → Game Adapter → Agent → Runtime → Training
                    ↘ Observation Layer ↗
```

See `docs/architecture.md` for the full diagram and data flow.

## Development Environment

**All commands must run inside the dip configuration.** Never invoke Ruby, Python, or system tools directly on the host.

```bash
dip provision          # build image, install Ruby gems and Python packages
dip learn              # PPO self-play training (auto-resumes from checkpoint)
dip rspec              # run the test suite
dip rubocop            # lint
dip scenario           # run a scenario script
dip shell              # open a shell inside the container
```

The container has RetroArch, Python 3, and PyTorch available.
Ruby gems are persisted in the `bundle` Docker volume; Python packages in the `pip` volume.
Re-run `dip provision` after changing `Gemfile` or `requirements.txt`.

## Running Tests

```bash
dip rspec
```

## Adding a New Game

See `docs/adding_new_fighting_game.md`.

## Understanding the Codebase

Before reading source files, check the `docs/` directory first:

- `docs/architecture.md` — layer diagram, data flow, module boundaries
- `docs/retroarch_integration.md` — display setup, xdotool, WRAM reading, UDP commands, keyboard config
- `docs/input_system.md` — how keyboard input maps to game actions
- `docs/observation_system.md` — observation/state extraction pipeline
- `docs/game_adapter_contract.md` — contract that game adapters must satisfy
- `docs/adding_new_fighting_game.md` — step-by-step guide for new games
- `docs/training_dsl.md` — training loop and recorder

If docs don't answer the question, read the source and **update the relevant doc** after making a significant change (new feature, refactor, changed protocol).

**Do not read `mk3.md` or `mk3.sfc`** — both are binary ROM files. `mk3.sfc` is the SNES ROM used at runtime; `mk3.md` is a leftover Genesis ROM (wrong format, not used).

## Communication Protocol

RetroArch ↔ Ruby uses two channels:

1. **Input**: xdotool keydown/keyup injected to the RetroArch window (via `Input::KeyboardInput`).
2. **State**: Save-state file reads via `Emulator::RetroArch::SaveStateReader` (WRAM extracted from snes9x `.state` files).
3. **Control**: UDP network commands on port 55355 via `Emulator::RetroArch::NetworkCommands`.

See `docs/retroarch_integration.md`.
